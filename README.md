# Programming Language I - Java Projects

This repository contains projects developed during the **Programming Language I** course, taught by **Professor Adriana Jacinto**. The course focuses on learning the basics of programming using **Java**, with a particular emphasis on integrating **JavaFX** for front-end development.

## Course Overview

In this course, we explored the foundational concepts of Java programming, including:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles (Classes, Objects, etc.)
- Basic data structures and algorithms
- GUI development using JavaFX for building user-friendly interfaces
- Database interaction using **JDBC** to connect to **MySQL**, perform CRUD operations, and manage data persistence

## JavaFX for Front-End Development

In addition to core Java programming, we used **JavaFX** to develop graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for our projects. JavaFX allows us to build rich, interactive desktop applications that are visually appealing and functional. The integration of JavaFX with Java helped demonstrate how to create user-friendly applications while reinforcing key programming concepts.

## JDBC with MySQL

We also learned how to integrate **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** with **MySQL** to enable communication between Java applications and databases. This involved:

- Establishing a connection to a MySQL database
- Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Managing database connections and handling SQL exceptions

By using JDBC, we were able to store and retrieve data efficiently, making our applications more dynamic and interactive.

## Project Overview

 **[JavaFX Project](https://github.com/darloscaniel/programming-language-1/tree/main/javafx-project)**  
Project created to demonstrate classes, attributes and methods using Java. This project applies the basic concepts of the Java language together with JavaFX to create the user interface and JDBC to create the database where class instances are stored.

**[Fraction Calculator](https://github.com/darloscaniel/programming-language-1/tree/main/fraction-calculator)**  
Fraction calculator created with Java to reinforce basic language concepts and practice programming logic.
